### Host (or Domain):

The host identifies the location of the resource, typically using a domain name or IP address. For instance, "www.example.com" or "192.168.1.1" could be the host.

### Port

### Path

The path provides the specific location and filename of the resource on the host. It's often used for specifying the directory structure and file name of web pages or files on a web server.

### Query

The query component is used for passing parameters or data to the resource, typically in the form of key-value pairs. It starts with a question mark "?" and can include multiple parameters separated by "&" symbols.

parsing is about breaking down complex data into its constituent parts so that the computer or software can work with and interpret the data effectively. The specific parsing rules and methods depend on the type of data being processed and the programming tools or libraries used.
