In Node.js, events are a fundamental part of the core modules and are used to facilitate communication between objects in your code. Node.js follows an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, and many of its built-in modules utilize the EventEmitter class to work with events.


In JavaScript, an event is an action or occurrence that can be detected and used to trigger a response in your code. Events can be various user actions or interactions with a web page, such as clicking a button, moving the mouse, pressing a key, or resizing the browser window. Events can also be system-generated, like when a page finishes loading, an element is modified, or a timer expires.
